# COVID-19-Case-Study
This project presents an in-depth analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on daily life using a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard visualizes key metrics and trends related to the pandemic, helping to understand its global impact.


PROBLEM STATEMENT:
This project aimed to analyse the impact and trends, patterns of the COVID-19 virus in each contry and all over the world. it is very crucial to know the patterns and trends of this virus for governments, health organizations, and the public to make informed decisions and implement effective measures. it is very essential to know:
Total cases in each country and globally
Daily active cases
Daily new cases
Death rates
Total deaths in each country and globally
Recovery rates
Total recovered cases
Daily new recoveries
Identification of critical and safe zones in each country and globally
Countries with the highest COVID-19 cases


APPROCH:
To address the problem statement, the following steps were taken:
1. Data Collection: Gathered COVID-19 data from reliable sources, including total cases, deaths, recoveries, and daily updates.
2. Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. Dashboard Creation: Utilized Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that includes various visualizations:
   a) Total Cases: Visualized the total number of COVID-19 cases in each country and globally.
   b) Active Cases: Displayed the total number of active cases each day.
   c) New Cases: Showed the number of new cases reported each day.
   d) Death Rate: Calculated and visualized the death rate of the virus.
   e) Total Deaths: Presented the total number of deaths in each country and globally.
   f) Recovery Rate: Calculated and visualized the recovery rate.
   g) Total Recovered: Displayed the total number of recovered cases.
   h) New Recovered: Showed the number of new recoveries each day.
   i) Critical and Safe Zones: Identified and visualized critical and safe zones in each country and globally.
   j) Highest Cases: Highlighted the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases.
4. Analysis and Insights: Analyzed the visualizations to draw insights and understand the impact of the pandemic on different regions and over time.


CONCLUSION:
The COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact, offering valuable insights into its spread, severity, and recovery trends. By visualizing key metrics, the dashboard helps stakeholders make informed decisions, implement effective measures, and better understand the global situation. This project underscores the importance of data analysis and visualization in addressing public health crises and supporting global health initiatives.
